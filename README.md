Machine learning project using a dataset yielded by an optics experiment from the EPFL optics laboratory

This project was made in 2020 as a semester final project for a ML course at the University of Crete.

The dataset was provided by the authors of the paper "Deep Neural Networks for seeing through multimode fibers" Kakkava Eirini and partners at the EPFL optics laboratory.
